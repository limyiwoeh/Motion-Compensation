# Motion-Compensation â€” MATLAB Video Encoding Mini Project

## Description
This project implements **motion estimation** and **motion compensation** techniques in MATLAB to reduce inter-frame motion in videos and improve visual stability.  
The workflow reads a video sequence, estimates motion vectors between consecutive frames, and applies compensation to align frames.  
Performance is evaluated in terms of **time taken to perform motion compensation** and **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**.

## How Motion Compensation Works in This Project
1. **Frame Extraction**  
   - The input video is read frame-by-frame using MATLABâ€™s VideoReader.  
   - Each frame is converted to grayscale for faster processing.

2. **Motion Estimation**  
   - Uses a block-matching approach to estimate motion vectors between current and reference frames.
   - Supports two search algorithms:
     - **Exhaustive Search** â€” Tests all possible block positions within the search range (highest accuracy, slower).
     - **Logarithmic Search** â€” Reduces the number of candidate positions tested (faster, slightly less accurate).

3. **Motion Compensation**  
   - Motion vectors are applied to shift image blocks, aligning them with their predicted position in the reference frame.
   - Compensated frames are reconstructed for output.

4. **Performance Evaluation**  
   - `mc_performance.m` measures:
     - **Processing Time** â€” total time taken for motion estimation and compensation.
     - **RMSE** â€” measures the difference between compensated frames and the reference.

## Parameters Affecting Performance

| Parameter        | Effect on Time Taken | Effect on RMSE |
|------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| **Block Size**   | Smaller blocks â†’ more computations per frame. Larger blocks â†’ faster but less flexible. | Smaller blocks â†’ lower RMSE (captures fine motion). Larger blocks â†’ higher RMSE (misses small details). |
| **Search Range** | Larger range â†’ more candidate positions to test (slower). Smaller range â†’ faster. | Larger range â†’ better chance to find correct match (lower RMSE). Smaller range â†’ may miss motion (higher RMSE). |
| **Search Algorithm** | Exhaustive â†’ slowest due to testing all candidates. Logarithmic â†’ faster by reducing search steps. | Exhaustive â†’ most accurate (lowest RMSE). Logarithmic â†’ slightly higher RMSE depending on motion complexity. |
